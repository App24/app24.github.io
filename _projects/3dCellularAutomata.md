# 3D Cellular Automata

---

I had watched a video released by [Tantan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63qlEpO73C4), in which he had made a 3D Cellular Automata in Rust, this inspired me to also create a cellular automata, but in C++ and with GLFW and OpenGL with Dear ImGUI for the GUI.
I also added a bare-bones multi-threading system.
