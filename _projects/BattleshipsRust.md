I have been wanting to learn the Rust programming language for a while now, so for a first project, I decided to remake my [Battleships](/projects/Battleships) game I made in university. I learnt a lot about Rust and how to structure the data and the code itself. I will keep on creating small projects to try and learn more about Rust, how it works and get better at it.
