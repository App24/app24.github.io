# ⭐Space Odyssey⭐

---

For one of my uni modules, we were tasked with creating a VR game, with the premise that it would be a puzzle game that had a 5 minute timer on it.

I have always been very interested in space, and around this time I was really invested in the game Outer Wilds. This worked really well for my game, as in Outer Wilds the game is set in 22 minute loops, where the sun explodes at the end of each loop. This inspired me to have my timer in the game be the sun.

The game went through many iterations, I first wanted the spaceship to be orbitting a black hole and having the timer be the ship falling into the black hole, I also wanted to make the black hole to be visually striking, but due to mostly my lack of skills in visual graphics I dropped this idea.
