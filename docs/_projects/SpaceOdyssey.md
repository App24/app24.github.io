# ⭐Space Odyssey⭐

For one of my uni modules, we were tasked with creating a VR game, with the premise that it would be a puzzle game that had a 5 minute timer on it.

I have always been very interested in space, and around this time I was really invested in the game Outer Wilds. This worked really well for my game, as in Outer Wilds the game is set in 22 minute loops, where the sun explodes at the end of each loop. This inspired me to have my timer in the game be the sun.

The game went through many iterations, I first wanted the spaceship to be orbitting a black hole and having the timer be the ship falling into the black hole, I also wanted to make the black hole to be visually striking, but due to mostly my lack of skills in visual graphics I dropped this idea. This then made me settle into using a star and having it explode after those 5 minutes, akin to Outer Wilds.

Another idea that had a few iterations through designs was how to get the information to repair the ship. I first started out wanting there to be a computer on-board the spaceship that you scrolled through screens to figure out the steps and what was needed to be fixed. However, I found that this would result in the puzzle being trivial, as it would end up being just reading and hence not too dificult. The next iteration of the puzzle was using a translation tool, at first this was a magnifying glass, that had the possibility of switching the language it was translating, but after feedback from lectures, I decided to leave it at one and switch from a magnifying glass to a tablet-type device, as this would allow for more to be shown in the tool.
