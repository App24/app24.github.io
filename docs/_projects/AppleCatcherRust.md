# 🍎AppleCatcher🍎

---

For my second Rust project, I decided to recreate one of my first games that I had made. I recreated my [AppleCatcher](/projects/AppleCatcher) game using the Bevy Game Engine. Having had no experience in Bevy before this, I had to redo the code multiple times when I wanted to add main menu, loading in assets, etc. But I learnt a lot from it.
