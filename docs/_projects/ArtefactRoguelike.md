# Artefact Roguelike

---

For our second trimester of year 1 at university, we were tasked to creating a rogue-like game in the console.

The game I created went through a few iterations, at first having a finite overworld to explore, in which it would be possible to explore caves and fight enemies. I decided to abandon this idea due to the sheer complexity, as well there not much to do in the overworld.

For the next iteration, I went with dungeons that the player could explore, fight enemies and travel between them. I wanted for these areas to be physically connected to each other through corridors, but I was unable to figure out the maths behind them. So I settled with having portals between different areas and the player finding these while walking by the walls of the dungeons.
