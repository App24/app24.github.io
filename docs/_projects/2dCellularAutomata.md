# 2D Cellular Automata

---

I have always been fascinated with Cellular Automata and how they naturally lead to self-replicating as well as self-sustaining creatures.

Whilst developing this I required GUI and so I looked for Dear ImGui bindings for C# and a way to connect these to SFML.Net, which resulted in me creating the repo [ImGui.Net SFML.Net](/projects/imguinetsfml).
