# Ric Tools

---

When developing [Illuminata](/projects/Illuminata), I started developing some tools for the project, and I knew that I would want to potentially use these in a future project as well. So I extracted the scripts relating to it.<br><br>
It has some level of abstraction, allowing for adding editor features without having to edit the RicUtils scripts.
