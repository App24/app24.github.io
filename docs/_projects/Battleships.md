For a module in my university course, we had to recreate the battleships boardgame in the console in C++. We had the criterion of having an AI to play against, I introduced different difficulties that would change how the AI behaves, having the easiest difficulty the AI attack random spots on the board, the next difficulty having the AI remember spots it hit a ship and attack around it, and the hardest having the AI have some strategy.
